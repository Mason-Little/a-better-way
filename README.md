# A Better Way

I got tired of navigation apps telling me the “fastest” route and then dumping me straight into traffic hell.

You know the ones:

- Stop-and-go highways
- Sitting on the clutch
- Coolant temps creeping up
- That one unprotected left turn that _always_ backs up

**A Better Way** isn’t about getting there as fast as possible.
It’s about getting there without hating the drive.

## The Idea

Most maps apps ask:

> “What’s the fastest route from A to B?”

This asks:

> “What’s the easiest route that doesn’t suck?”

I’m totally fine if a route takes longer **as long as I’m actually moving**.

No traffic, fewer stops, fewer sketchy turns — even if it adds time.

---

## What That Actually Means

Let’s say you’re going from A to B.

- **Route A**
  - 15 minutes with no traffic
  - 30 minutes once it backs up
  - Highway, stop-and-go, constant braking
- **Route B**
  - 45 minutes
  - Basically no traffic
  - Back roads, steady pace, predictable

Every normal nav app picks Route A.

**A Better Way picks Route B.**
Because sitting still is worse than driving longer.

## Why I Care (and Maybe You Do Too)

This is especially nice if you:

- Drive manual
- Drive something fast, loud, or modified
- Care about temps, clutch wear, or just not being stressed
- Would rather cruise than fight traffic

High-performance cars don’t love traffic.
Neither do I.

## How Routing Is Different

This isn’t magic — it’s just different priorities.

### Keeps You Moving

- Tries to avoid stop-and-go
- Prefers roads with steady flow

### Avoids Bad Left Turns

- Unprotected lefts at stop signs suck
- They stack cars, waste time, and kill momentum
- Right turns are usually quicker and smoother, so it favors those

### Highways Aren’t Mandatory

- If the highway’s clogged, it’ll route around it
- Back roads are fair game if they flow better

### Easier on the Car

- Less idling
- Less heat soak
- More airflow, happier engine

## Time Isn’t Sacred Here

You get to choose how flexible you want to be.

- **Close to fastest** – don’t go too far out of the way
- **Balanced** – trade some time for less traffic
- **Avoid traffic at all costs** – just let me drive

If a route is longer but clearly easier, the app isn’t afraid to pick it.

## Sharing the “Better Way”

If you ignore the route and do your own thing — that’s kind of the point.

At the end of the drive, it asks:

> **“Want to share your better way?”**

You can submit:

- Back roads locals actually use
- Turns everyone avoids
- Intersections that always clog
- Routes that never show up as “fast” but always work

No usernames. No clout.
Just real driver knowledge helping other drivers.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not trying to win ETA benchmarks
- Not built for delivery drivers on a stopwatch
- Not trying to replace Google Maps or Waze

This is for people who care how the drive feels, not just when it ends.

---

## Why This Exists

Because sometimes the fastest route is miserable.

And sometimes the better route is just…
**a better way**.
